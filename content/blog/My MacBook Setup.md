My philosophy for my setup is to keep things minimal. I never install an app just because “everyone uses it.” Instead of one big bloated app that does a lot of things averagely, I prefer multiple small apps that each do one thing well. I wrote this to keep track of what I’ve installed and to help me re-examine which apps I really need.

# Productivity

- **Obsidian**: Notes, writings
- **Notion**
- **Typora**
- **Antinote**
- **ChatGPT**
- **Claude**

# Development

- **Orbstack**
- **Postman**
- **1Password**
- **Ghostty**: I previously used Warp, but Warp kept pushing its AI features. I prefer a more minimal terminal app.
- **VirtualBox**
- **Cursor**
- **VSCode**
- **DBngin**

# Work

- **Microsoft Word**, **PowerPoint**, **Excel** : I might not need these in the future
- **Zoom**
- **Slack**

# Utils

- **AdGuard**: I bought the lifetime subscription during Black Friday sales. uBlock might be an alternative.

- **October**: A tool to sync Kobo eReader highlights to Readwise
- **CleanShot X**
