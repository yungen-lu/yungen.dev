I felt a lot after watching this. The story was excellent, but more than that, it made me reflect on how narrow-minded and biased I used to be about what a “film” should look like and what forms or styles were better.  

I never really watched animation before because I used to be biased against it, but after seeing *Attack on Titan*, my perspective started to shift. And today, this film has once again redefined what animation means to me.  

Whether it was the exaggerated yet harmonious colors or the flashy, impossible-to-achieve cinematography that live-action films could never pull off, this film made me understand that “cinema” isn’t just about telling a story through real-life imagery.  

At times, animation can convey a story in a way that feels even more true to life, making it easier for audiences to connect emotionally.  

In short, this might just be my favorite Marvel film so far. It’s good—seriously, it’s really good.
